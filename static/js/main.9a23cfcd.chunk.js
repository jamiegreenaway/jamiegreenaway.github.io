A couple of minutes on and Crossgates 3 received the ball from a cut back from near the right flag but could only blast his 20 yard effort, from the right of the \u201cD\u201d, well over the bar. \'Shire\'s 1st attack of the match came in the 12th minute when Trialist 2 picked up a loose ball on the right wing, 25 yard out, and hit a low shot which was well held by the home keeper in the centre of his goal. With 21 minutes gone Crossgates 6 took a corner from the right which found the head of Crossgates 19 in the centre of the box. The home defender was unlucky to see his 10 yard attempt hit the bar near the left post before it was cleared. A couple of minutes later Trialist 3 charged up the left wing before sending a through ball, from 25 yards, to Kai Wilson just inside the left of the box at the touchline. The young forward then hit a 1st time low cross over the 6 yard area but there was no one there to take advantage, Trialist 2 being unable to gather the ball at the far side. In the next minute Marc Sludden tried a shot from a free kick, just right of the box 20 yards out, but the ball drifted harmlessly over the right post. Primrose then went up the pitch and Connor Greene did well to block Crossgates 7 shot just inside the right of the box for a corner after Trialist 3 had initially lost the ball in a challenge. In the 33rd minute Dean Watson, in the \u201cD\u201d, sent a low forward pass to his right into the path of Trialist 7 who fired off a shot from 15 yards which the home keeper did well get down to block for a corner. 1 minute before the break Iain Ure had to react well to save following a short Trialist 2 pass back but the ball then spun to Crossgates 9 who tried a 10 yard shot from inside the left of the box. This was also blocked but the ball returned to Crossgates 11, just in the box from the left of the \u201cD\u201d. However, the Primrose midfielder hit his attempt well wide of the bottom of the right post."},{"paragraph":"With the 1st attack of the 2nd half in the 50th minute Shire went into the lead in the match. Trialist 15 picked up the ball midway in the Primrose half on the right and strode though 3 players before sending a perfect pass, from 25 yards right of centre, through to Watson on the 18 yard line left of the \u201cD\u201d. Watson then steadied himself before dinking a shot over the keeper low into the right of the net. 6 minutes on and Ure was alert to the danger when he raced out to the \u201cD\u201d to clear a short pass back with Crossgates 15 closing. In the next minute \'Shire went up field and Wilson tried a floated shot from the left corner of the box which narrowly went by the foot of the right post. \'Shire did have the ball in the next 2 minutes later through Captain Connor Greene but the referee had already blown for a foul in favour of the home team. With 1 hour gone Dean Ritchie send the ball long, from 70 yards on the right, releasing Wilson up the same wing. Wilson in turn crossed the ball from 30 yards to Kenny Barr in the centre but the midfielder\'s subsequent shot was blocked and cleared. 4 minutes later Trialist 15 gathered the ball in the \u201cD\u201d and fired off a shot but it was blocked just him front of him and cleared. Then a couple of minutes later a delightful cross field pass from Trialist 14, just behind the centre circle on the left, sent Trialist 15 clear at the right corner of the box. Trialist 15 looked up and smashed off a terrific shot which smacked off the underside of the centre of the bar before it was cleared. It was all Shire now and in the 71st minute Barr sent a short pass to his right to Ritchie. Ritchie spotted the keeper slightly off his line and tried a 40 yard shot from the right wing which only just went over the left of the middle of the bar. 4 minutes later, Shire\'s pressure finally paid off. Barr sent in a free kick, from just outside the box 2 yards in from the right junction, picking out Wilson at the back post. The forward rose, easily brushing off a defender\'s challenge, to head home low into the left of the net from 6 yards. 2-0 Shire. Shire were taken aback in the 82nd minute when the home team pulled a goal back. Archie Campbell slotted a 10 yard pass through from the right to Cammy Muirhead, 15 yards from goal, and he swung around before sending a low shot into the left corner of the net. Then only 4 minutes later Campbell sent in a low 30 yard cross from the left wing into the 6 yard area which was missed by everyone, including Ure, before the ball crept into the net at the right post. This proved to be the last action of the match with the friendly ended all square at 2-2."},{"paragraph":"Shire: 1) Iain Ure 2) Trialist (RB) 3) Trialist (LB) 4) Connor Greene (Captain.

Watson then cut right and fired off a low shot which was saved by Shea Dowie at the foot of the left post. In the 11th minute \'Shire went into an early lead. A Jack Hodge cross from the right wing, 20 yards out, was sent over to the back post. Under pressure from Danny McDonald Dowie was just able to push the ball straight out only for it to go as far as Trialist 10 who calmly shot home low into the left corner of the net from 10 yards. 3 minutes later Willis Hare sent in a great curling cross from the 15 yards out from the right flag. Luckily for \'Shire the unmarked Ben Bathgate missed his 6 yard header at the back post and the ball harmlessly went out for a goal kick. 7 minutes on and Jordan Hopkinson\'s corner from the left found Darren Handling clear, left of the penalty spot, and he sent a net bound header towards the bottom left corner of the goal. However, Trialist 2 managed to save the day for \'Shire and clear the ball off the line to safety. A couple of minutes later Bathgate floated a cross come shot into the \'Shire box, from 25 yards out on the left touchline line, which narrowly went by the base of the right post. With 26 minutes gone Watson had a great turn at the left of the 18 yard line, going by Willis Hare before shooting low from 12 yards. Dowie was there to save with his feet but the ball came out to Kenny Barr in the centre of the box. Unfortunately, the \'Shire Captain for the day could only send his 15 yard shot a few yards over the right side of the bar. 1 minute on and the home team drew level. James Redpath, on the left touchline, 25 yards out, crossed the ball into in the box finding Jamie Devlin on the right side of the 6 yard line and he headed home into the top right corner of the net. In the 33rd minute Bathgate, in the \u201cD\u201d, received the ball from 18 yards out on the left touchline and tried a side footed attempt which went just over the right post. 5 minutes on and Kyle Ewing launched a great long ball, from midway in his own half on the left, picking out Hodge just inside the box on the left. Hodge, however, wasn\'t able to get a proper shot away and his attempt was blocked and cleared. A couple of minutes later Dean Whitson brought down McDonald in the \u201cD\u201d and the ball then travelled right into the path of Hodge. Hodge dribbled into the box before shooting but the attempt was blocked and cleared. Then Barr\'s corner from the left found Trialist 12 in the box, 10 yards out right of centre, but he was only able to head well wide of the right post. 1 minute into injury time Trialist 2 picked up the ball, 25 yards out on the right, and drove to the right of the \u201cD\u201d but he slipped just as he was shooting which caused the ball to go well wide of the right post. Straight after Trialist 3 sent over a cross from the left flag to an unmarked Hodge at the near post, 6 yards from goal, but he got his bearings all wrong and sent his header 5 yards wide of the left post."},{"paragraph":"At half time \'Shire made a flurry of substitutes giving players much needed game time. In the 48th minute McDonald sent a low pass, from 10 yards out from the right flag, to Dean Ritchie who had his shirt tugged whilst shooting and a result the ball went just over the right post. The referee wasn\'t interested in the expected penalty award. Out of the blue in the 55th minute Hopkinson, 30 yards out on the right, spotted Ross Connelly slightly off his line and immediately hit a perfectly judged lob shot which flew over the keeper and into the top left corner of the net, putting the home side into the lead. \'Shire fought back and a few minutes later Trialist 3\'s corner from the right picked out Connor Greene at the back post but he was only able to send his 8 yard header high over the left post. Then in the 59th minute Ritchie floated over a cross, from left of centre 25 yards out, to Trialist 3 at the right corner of the box and he moved to his left before curling in a shot which went just over the left post. 8 minutes later Darren Smith wasted a 25 yard free in the centre with a tame low shot which went straight to the hands of Connelly on his goal line. With 80 minutes gone Trialist 19 sent in an inviting cross, from the right touchline 20 yards from the flag, along the 6 yard line but there was no one there to get on the end of it. A couple of minutes on Smith\'s corner from the right was met by the head of Cammy Dawson but he sent his header high over the bar from the penalty spot. The final moment of the match came in the 90th minute when Greene tried a speculative 40 yard shot from the centre of the field but the flight of the ball was caught by the wind and as a result the ball sailed high over the bar.

With only 1 minute gone \u2018Shire had a great chance to take the lead. Jack Hodge crossed the ball over from the left corner of the box to Trialist 7, in the right of the area 10 yards out. Trialist 7 then passed the ball back to Hodge who in turn moved it on from the left junction of the 6 yard box over to the unmarked Kai Wilson at the opposite corner of the 6 yard area. The young forward rose to head towards goal but the ball went just over the left post. In the 9th minute Wilson sent to ball, from the centre of the field 20 yards out, into the path of Trialist 3 just left to the \u201cD\u201d. The left back then ran just into the box, going 1 on1 with home Trialist keeper but he was only able to send his shot narrowly beyond the base of the right post. A couple of minutes later Trialist 7, at the right edge of the box 10 yards from the goal line, fired over a cross ball to Wilson who hit a 1st time 8 yard central shot but it was blocked by Sean Guiney just in front of him and cleared. Then Marc Sludden sent a perfect pass from the right halfway touchline to Trialist 11 in the left of the box 5 yards out from the goal line. Trialist 11 then sent a cross back over the 6 yard box but there were no \u2018Shire player there to take advantage and the ball was cleared by the home defence. In the 23rd minute Trialist 1 had to block Wilson\u2019s 6 yard shot from the left at the base of the left post before it was cleared. A couple of minutes on and Trialist 11 danced round Trialist 16 at left corner of the box and then passed to Jack Hodge in the box in front of him. However, the midfielder didn\u2019t gather the ball properly and the chance was lost. The next minute saw the home team\u2019s 1st shot of the match when Trialist 16 sent over a cross, from 25 yards out on the right wing, which was met by Trialist 6 to his left in the centre. The LTHV captain looked up and fired off a shot but it was easily caught by Ross Conelly at the left post. Finally, in the 27th minute \u2018Shire\u2019s dominance paid off. Barr\u2019s cross from the goal line, 10 yards out from the left post, picked out Wilson on the 6 yard line right of centre and he make no mistake shooting low into the middle of the net. A few minute on and Tony Coutts, at the left post, had to head clear a Joe Viola corner from the left. With 32 minutes gone Wilson, at the left side of the box, received a long ball from the centre circle and he squared the ball to Sudden just right of centre. Sludden immediately tried a 1st time 16 yard curling shot but it was held by Trialist 1 in the centre of his goal. Then 1st Trialist 6 for the home team and then Hodge for \u2018Shire had wild shots from just outside the centre of the box which flew high and wide of the left and right posts respectively. After this LTHV won 3 corners in 2 minutes, the 3rd in the 42nd minute resulted in an unexpected reverse for \u2018Shire. Joe Viola swung the corner in from the right and it was headed on by Trialist 15 it the near post. The ball travelled over to the back post where Sean Wringe headed head home from 6 yards into the centre of the net. "},{"paragraph":"\u2018Shire changed nearly half their team at the half time with 5 substitutes coming on. It was therefore no surprise that the team took a little while to re-find their bearings and it meant that LTHV had their best period of the match. In the 50th minute Trialist 7 sent a cross over from the right touchline, 18 yards out, to Trialist 16 who tried a 12 yard header from the left of the box which went narrowly over the right LTHV post. LTHV had a great chance in the 56th minute to take the lead when Trialist 6\u2019s freekick, from the right corner of the box, was met by Trialist 2 in the centre of the 6 yard line. Luckly for \u2018Shire the defender\u2019s aim was out and the ball went well wide of the top of the right post. A couple of minutes on and a cut back from the same player, near the right post, found Wringe at the penalty spot. The forward immediately hit a 1st time shot but it went well over the centre of the bar. In the 62nd minute Coutts lent on the shoulder of Trialist 3, in the left side of the box, causing the home defender to crash to the ground. The referee immediately awarded the penalty and Trialist 6 stepped up 1 minute later to smash the ball into the top of the centre of the net to put his side into the lead. Only 4 minutes later, following a crunching \u2018Shire tackle a stramash broke out amongst the players. The end result was that \u2018Shire\u2019s Trialist 15 and LTHV\u2019S Trialist 6 were shown straight red cards, reducing each side to 10 men. With 69 minutes gone LTHV won a 20 yard free kick on the left but Trialist 2\u2019s resulting shot went a few yards over the right post. It was at this point in the match that \u2018Shire started to regain control of the match. Trialist 7 hit a low 6 yard attempt in the 71st minute, from left of centre, which was saved by LTHV Trialist 1 for a corner. Barr took that left corner and it was cleared but only to Trialist 7, left of the \u201cD\u201d, and he tried a shot which was blocked and cleared. A few minutes later Ewing was unable to get his unmarked 8 yard header in the centre of the box, from a Barr corner on the left, on target and it sailed high over the left post.

We\u2019re under no illusions that it\u2019s going to be an overnight fix, but hopefully if we can all work together then we can get some level of consistency that we, as the management team, are looking for.\u201d"},{"paragraph":"Of the ten new arrivals listed above, seven of them are young, local talents from the Falkirk area."},{"paragraph":"\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young boys that have came in clearly.

We\u2019re in a position where, for us, we\u2019re trying to give players\u2019 the opportunity to go and prove themselves at this level. Hopefully they can use it as a stepping stone as it means that the players are doing well, which then means the club are doing well.\u201d"},{"paragraph":"\u201cYou can\u2019t disregard what the players produced last season. They deserve every bit of praise that they got because they were excellent for the club, and once again we touch on the players like (Kieran Gibbons, Andy Rodden, Jamie Hamilton etc.) who are very, very difficult to replace at this level and you potentially can\u2019t replace them like-for-like, but what we can do is try and bring in other players who are suitable to the way we\u2019re wanting to play and it\u2019s up to them to now go and show how valuable they are, and the remaining squad from last season can continue from where we left off.\u201d"},{"paragraph":"The Shire begin the new
