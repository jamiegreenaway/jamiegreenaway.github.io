A couple of minutes on and Crossgates 3 received the ball from a cut back from near the right flag but could only blast his 20 yard effort, from the right of the \u201cD\u201d, well over the bar. \'Shire\'s 1st attack of the match came in the 12th minute when Trialist 2 picked up a loose ball on the right wing, 25 yard out, and hit a low shot which was well held by the home keeper in the centre of his goal. With 21 minutes gone Crossgates 6 took a corner from the right which found the head of Crossgates 19 in the centre of the box. The home defender was unlucky to see his 10 yard attempt hit the bar near the left post before it was cleared. A couple of minutes later Trialist 3 charged up the left wing before sending a through ball, from 25 yards, to Kai Wilson just inside the left of the box at the touchline. The young forward then hit a 1st time low cross over the 6 yard area but there was no one there to take advantage, Trialist 2 being unable to gather the ball at the far side. In the next minute Marc Sludden tried a shot from a free kick, just right of the box 20 yards out, but the ball drifted harmlessly over the right post. Primrose then went up the pitch and Connor Greene did well to block Crossgates 7 shot just inside the right of the box for a corner after Trialist 3 had initially lost the ball in a challenge. In the 33rd minute Dean Watson, in the \u201cD\u201d, sent a low forward pass to his right into the path of Trialist 7 who fired off a shot from 15 yards which the home keeper did well get down to block for a corner. 1 minute before the break Iain Ure had to react well to save following a short Trialist 2 pass back but the ball then spun to Crossgates 9 who tried a 10 yard shot from inside the left of the box. This was also blocked but the ball returned to Crossgates 11, just in the box from the left of the \u201cD\u201d. However, the Primrose midfielder hit his attempt well wide of the bottom of the right post."},{"paragraph":"With the 1st attack of the 2nd half in the 50th minute Shire went into the lead in the match. Trialist 15 picked up the ball midway in the Primrose half on the right and strode though 3 players before sending a perfect pass, from 25 yards right of centre, through to Watson on the 18 yard line left of the \u201cD\u201d. Watson then steadied himself before dinking a shot over the keeper low into the right of the net. 6 minutes on and Ure was alert to the danger when he raced out to the \u201cD\u201d to clear a short pass back with Crossgates 15 closing. In the next minute \'Shire went up field and Wilson tried a floated shot from the left corner of the box which narrowly went by the foot of the right post. \'Shire did have the ball in the next 2 minutes later through Captain Connor Greene but the referee had already blown for a foul in favour of the home team. With 1 hour gone Dean Ritchie send the ball long, from 70 yards on the right, releasing Wilson up the same wing. Wilson in turn crossed the ball from 30 yards to Kenny Barr in the centre but the midfielder\'s subsequent shot was blocked and cleared. 4 minutes later Trialist 15 gathered the ball in the \u201cD\u201d and fired off a shot but it was blocked just him front of him and cleared. Then a couple of minutes later a delightful cross field pass from Trialist 14, just behind the centre circle on the left, sent Trialist 15 clear at the right corner of the box. Trialist 15 looked up and smashed off a terrific shot which smacked off the underside of the centre of the bar before it was cleared. It was all Shire now and in the 71st minute Barr sent a short pass to his right to Ritchie. Ritchie spotted the keeper slightly off his line and tried a 40 yard shot from the right wing which only just went over the left of the middle of the bar. 4 minutes later, Shire\'s pressure finally paid off. Barr sent in a free kick, from just outside the box 2 yards in from the right junction, picking out Wilson at the back post. The forward rose, easily brushing off a defender\'s challenge, to head home low into the left of the net from 6 yards. 2-0 Shire. Shire were taken aback in the 82nd minute when the home team pulled a goal back. Archie Campbell slotted a 10 yard pass through from the right to Cammy Muirhead, 15 yards from goal, and he swung around before sending a low shot into the left corner of the net. Then only 4 minutes later Campbell sent in a low 30 yard cross from the left wing into the 6 yard area which was missed by everyone, including Ure, before the ball crept into the net at the right post. This proved to be the last action of the match with the friendly ended all square at 2-2."},{"paragraph":"Shire: 1) Iain Ure 2) Trialist (RB) 3) Trialist (LB) 4) Connor Greene (Captain.

Watson then cut right and fired off a low shot which was saved by Shea Dowie at the foot of the left post. In the 11th minute \'Shire went into an early lead. A Jack Hodge cross from the right wing, 20 yards out, was sent over to the back post. Under pressure from Danny McDonald Dowie was just able to push the ball straight out only for it to go as far as Trialist 10 who calmly shot home low into the left corner of the net from 10 yards. 3 minutes later Willis Hare sent in a great curling cross from the 15 yards out from the right flag. Luckily for \'Shire the unmarked Ben Bathgate missed his 6 yard header at the back post and the ball harmlessly went out for a goal kick. 7 minutes on and Jordan Hopkinson\'s corner from the left found Darren Handling clear, left of the penalty spot, and he sent a net bound header towards the bottom left corner of the goal. However, Trialist 2 managed to save the day for \'Shire and clear the ball off the line to safety. A couple of minutes later Bathgate floated a cross come shot into the \'Shire box, from 25 yards out on the left touchline line, which narrowly went by the base of the right post. With 26 minutes gone Watson had a great turn at the left of the 18 yard line, going by Willis Hare before shooting low from 12 yards. Dowie was there to save with his feet but the ball came out to Kenny Barr in the centre of the box. Unfortunately, the \'Shire Captain for the day could only send his 15 yard shot a few yards over the right side of the bar. 1 minute on and the home team drew level. James Redpath, on the left touchline, 25 yards out, crossed the ball into in the box finding Jamie Devlin on the right side of the 6 yard line and he headed home into the top right corner of the net. In the 33rd minute Bathgate, in the \u201cD\u201d, received the ball from 18 yards out on the left touchline and tried a side footed attempt which went just over the right post. 5 minutes on and Kyle Ewing launched a great long ball, from midway in his own half on the left, picking out Hodge just inside the box on the left. Hodge, however, wasn\'t able to get a proper shot away and his attempt was blocked and cleared. A couple of minutes later Dean Whitson brought down McDonald in the \u201cD\u201d and the ball then travelled right into the path of Hodge. Hodge dribbled into the box before shooting but the attempt was blocked and cleared. Then Barr\'s corner from the left found Trialist 12 in the box, 10 yards out right of centre, but he was only able to head well wide of the right post. 1 minute into injury time Trialist 2 picked up the ball, 25 yards out on the right, and drove to the right of the \u201cD\u201d but he slipped just as he was shooting which caused the ball to go well wide of the right post. Straight after Trialist 3 sent over a cross from the left flag to an unmarked Hodge at the near post, 6 yards from goal, but he got his bearings all wrong and sent his header 5 yards wide of the left post."},{"paragraph":"At half time \'Shire made a flurry of substitutes giving players much needed game time. In the 48th minute McDonald sent a low pass, from 10 yards out from the right flag, to Dean Ritchie who had his shirt tugged whilst shooting and a result the ball went just over the right post. The referee wasn\'t interested in the expected penalty award. Out of the blue in the 55th minute Hopkinson, 30 yards out on the right, spotted Ross Connelly slightly off his line and immediately hit a perfectly judged lob shot which flew over the keeper and into the top left corner of the net, putting the home side into the lead. \'Shire fought back and a few minutes later Trialist 3\'s corner from the right picked out Connor Greene at the back post but he was only able to send his 8 yard header high over the left post. Then in the 59th minute Ritchie floated over a cross, from left of centre 25 yards out, to Trialist 3 at the right corner of the box and he moved to his left before curling in a shot which went just over the left post. 8 minutes later Darren Smith wasted a 25 yard free in the centre with a tame low shot which went straight to the hands of Connelly on his goal line. With 80 minutes gone Trialist 19 sent in an inviting cross, from the right touchline 20 yards from the flag, along the 6 yard line but there was no one there to get on the end of it. A couple of minutes on Smith\'s corner from the right was met by the head of Cammy Dawson but he sent his header high over the bar from the penalty spot. The final moment of the match came in the 90th minute when Greene tried a speculative 40 yard shot from the centre of the field but the flight of the ball was caught by the wind and as a result the ball sailed high over the bar.

With only 1 minute gone \u2018Shire had a great chance to take the lead. Jack Hodge crossed the ball over from the left corner of the box to Trialist 7, in the right of the area 10 yards out. Trialist 7 then passed the ball back to Hodge who in turn moved it on from the left junction of the 6 yard box over to the unmarked Kai Wilson at the opposite corner of the 6 yard area. The young forward rose to head towards goal but the ball went just over the left post. In the 9th minute Wilson sent to ball, from the centre of the field 20 yards out, into the path of Trialist 3 just left to the \u201cD\u201d. The left back then ran just into the box, going 1 on1 with home Trialist keeper but he was only able to send his shot narrowly beyond the base of the right post. A couple of minutes later Trialist 7, at the right edge of the box 10 yards from the goal line, fired over a cross ball to Wilson who hit a 1st time 8 yard central shot but it was blocked by Sean Guiney just in front of him and cleared. Then Marc Sludden sent a perfect pass from the right halfway touchline to Trialist 11 in the left of the box 5 yards out from the goal line. Trialist 11 then sent a cross back over the 6 yard box but there were no \u2018Shire player there to take advantage and the ball was cleared by the home defence. In the 23rd minute Trialist 1 had to block Wilson\u2019s 6 yard shot from the left at the base of the left post before it was cleared. A couple of minutes on and Trialist 11 danced round Trialist 16 at left corner of the box and then passed to Jack Hodge in the box in front of him. However, the midfielder didn\u2019t gather the ball properly and the chance was lost. The next minute saw the home team\u2019s 1st shot of the match when Trialist 16 sent over a cross, from 25 yards out on the right wing, which was met by Trialist 6 to his left in the centre. The LTHV captain looked up and fired off a shot but it was easily caught by Ross Conelly at the left post. Finally, in the 27th minute \u2018Shire\u2019s dominance paid off. Barr\u2019s cross from the goal line, 10 yards out from the left post, picked out Wilson on the 6 yard line right of centre and he make no mistake shooting low into the middle of the net. A few minute on and Tony Coutts, at the left post, had to head clear a Joe Viola corner from the left. With 32 minutes gone Wilson, at the left side of the box, received a long ball from the centre circle and he squared the ball to Sudden just right of centre. Sludden immediately tried a 1st time 16 yard curling shot but it was held by Trialist 1 in the centre of his goal. Then 1st Trialist 6 for the home team and then Hodge for \u2018Shire had wild shots from just outside the centre of the box which flew high and wide of the left and right posts respectively. After this LTHV won 3 corners in 2 minutes, the 3rd in the 42nd minute resulted in an unexpected reverse for \u2018Shire. Joe Viola swung the corner in from the right and it was headed on by Trialist 15 it the near post. The ball travelled over to the back post where Sean Wringe headed head home from 6 yards into the centre of the net. "},{"paragraph":"\u2018Shire changed nearly half their team at the half time with 5 substitutes coming on. It was therefore no surprise that the team took a little while to re-find their bearings and it meant that LTHV had their best period of the match. In the 50th minute Trialist 7 sent a cross over from the right touchline, 18 yards out, to Trialist 16 who tried a 12 yard header from the left of the box which went narrowly over the right LTHV post. LTHV had a great chance in the 56th minute to take the lead when Trialist 6\u2019s freekick, from the right corner of the box, was met by Trialist 2 in the centre of the 6 yard line. Luckly for \u2018Shire the defender\u2019s aim was out and the ball went well wide of the top of the right post. A couple of minutes on and a cut back from the same player, near the right post, found Wringe at the penalty spot. The forward immediately hit a 1st time shot but it went well over the centre of the bar. In the 62nd minute Coutts lent on the shoulder of Trialist 3, in the left side of the box, causing the home defender to crash to the ground. The referee immediately awarded the penalty and Trialist 6 stepped up 1 minute later to smash the ball into the top of the centre of the net to put his side into the lead. Only 4 minutes later, following a crunching \u2018Shire tackle a stramash broke out amongst the players. The end result was that \u2018Shire\u2019s Trialist 15 and LTHV\u2019S Trialist 6 were shown straight red cards, reducing each side to 10 men. With 69 minutes gone LTHV won a 20 yard free kick on the left but Trialist 2\u2019s resulting shot went a few yards over the right post. It was at this point in the match that \u2018Shire started to regain control of the match. Trialist 7 hit a low 6 yard attempt in the 71st minute, from left of centre, which was saved by LTHV Trialist 1 for a corner. Barr took that left corner and it was cleared but only to Trialist 7, left of the \u201cD\u201d, and he tried a shot which was blocked and cleared. A few minutes later Ewing was unable to get his unmarked 8 yard header in the centre of the box, from a Barr corner on the left, on target and it sailed high over the left post.

The new faces were Shaun Brown, Kyle Ewing, Dean Ritchie, Scott Honeyman and Daniel McDonald. New signings Aiden Clocherty, Marc Sludden and Kai Wilson were also listed on the substitutes bench."},{"paragraph":"3 minutes into the match Scott Honeyman sent an inviting cross over from the right wing, near the goal line, which over the 6 yard area but Daniel McDonald was just unable to control the ball beyond the left post and it went out for a goal kick. Then Euan McGill hit a Scholars free kick from just right of the \u201cD\u201d but it went well over the left post. With 8 minutes gone Honeyman, in front of the right corner of the box, sent the ball to Jack Hodge in the centre of the 6 yard line. Unfortunately, under pressure from Ben Fry and two defenders, he was only able to scoop his shot narrowly over the centre of the bar. 1 minute on and another Honeyman cross from the right touchline, 10 yards out, went low to Dean Watson. As he was going for the ball, at the right of the 6 yard line, Watson was tacked by Ciaran McAninch causing him to scuff his shot which allowed the ball to be easily gathered by Fry beyond the right post. \u2018Shire suffered a setback 2 minutes later when Euan McGill passed the ball from the left corner of the box to Calum Rae and he turned and shot low, from a few yard left of the penalty spot, into the bottom left corner of the net to put his side ahead. In the 17th minute a Hodge corner from the left picked out Kyle Ewing at the right of the 6 yard line but the defender just couldn\u2019t reach the ball properly and it skiffed off his head before going went well wide of the right post. 4 minutes on \u2018Shire drew level on the night with what was their 400th ever Lowland League goal. Andy Kay launch the ball up the right wing from 35 yards towards the right corner flag. McAninch went to shepherd the ball out for a goal kick only for Honeyman to dash up the wing, from 10 yards away, stealing the ball from him at the flag before driving along the goal line into the box. Honeyman then cut the ball back to McDonald at the right corner of the 6 yard area and under a challenge from Marucs Lavery promptly fired the ball home low in the far corner of the net. 5 minutes later Ewing had to block a McGill 15 yard shot in the left of the box. Then with 28 minutes gone \u2018Shire were unlucky not to go in front when Honeyman\u2019s cross from the right wing, 15 yards out, was met by Hodge near the penalty spot but his header came off the base of the right post and travelled right, away to safety. In the same minute McDonald had a shot just in front of the \u201cD\u201d which was saved by Fry at the left side of the goal. With 33 minutes gone Rae hit a low shot from right of the \u201cD\u201d which took a deflection off Ewing for a corner. Berry sent that left corner into the near post and Ross Connelly did well to punch clear under pressure. 1 minute into injury time a cross from the right by McAninch was met by McGill, just left of the \u2018Shire penalty spot, but his header was easily held by Connelly on his goal line at the right post."},{"paragraph":"4 minutes into the 2nd half \u2018Shire had a couple of corners but weren\u2019t able to make them count. Then 1 minute later, 16 yards out from the left flag, Watson crossed to the feet of Hodge in the centre of the 6 yard line but he was just unable to get onto the ball on the 6 yard line. A couple of minutes later Connelly had to punch clear from his goal line at the back post a Berry corner from the left. 5 minutes on, 10 yards out from the right post on the goal line, Ben MacIver-Redwood sent the ball over Connelly but it was a fraction too high for James Stoker at the left post and the chance was lost. The match then entered a spell where it became more physical with 2 bookings for each team in the next 8 minutes. In the 68th minute Hodge sent a left corner over to the back of the box where Ewing headed it back down into the centre. It bounded up and was met by Kay who sent in a 7 yard net bound header only for it to be saved by Fry who tipped the ball up before catching at the 2nd attempt. 6 minutes on Ben Heal gathered the ball at the centre spot and ran all the way into the \u2018Shire box before releasing a low 10 yard shot which was blocked by Connelly. The ball rebounded out to Buronbek Mirzasalimov, inside the left of the box, and his follow up attempt sailed high over the centre of the bar. In the 71 minute Matty Burrows sent a right corner to MacIver-Redwood, in the centre 6 yards out, but the forward could only turn his header narrowly by the base of the left post. As the match drew to a conclusion Trialist 17 was booked for protesting that a Scholars free kick deep in their own half was being taken 20 yards too far forward. Then Kay continued the protests which resulted in him being shown a straight red card. Over the full 90 minutes the 1-1 result was a fair reflection of the play. \u2018Shire had started very brightly and for wont of more accurate finishing could have been well ahead before the Scholars took the game to \u2018Shire in the 2nd period."},{"paragraph":"Shire: 1) Ross Connelly 2) Kenny Barr (RB) 3) Shaun Brown (LB) 4) Kyle Ewing (LCD) 5) Connor Greene (Captain) (RCD) 6) Dean Ritchie (DLCM.

Honeyman then sent the ball low to the near post and Alex Hamilton had to get down to cut out the ball for a corner with Dean Watson waiting behind him to pounce in the 6 yard box. 2 minutes later Jack Hodge sent over a free kick, from left of the penalty box 6 yards out, to Kyle Ewing in the centre of the 6 yard area. The defender then headed the ball down to his left but Matthew Dick reacted 1st to clear before Watson could get onto the end of it. 1 minute on the students went into the lead with their 1st attack of the match. In the middle of the \u2018Shire half Lewis Hendry sent a low square pass to Louis Maurice in the centre and, with Dean Ritchie in close attendance, he slotted the ball through to Patrick Baird at the left of the \u201cD\u201d. The midfielder moved into the box before placing his 15 yard shot beyond Ross Connelly low into the right corner of the net. With 15 minutes gone \u2018Shire played a passing move up the right wing which culminated in Shaun Brown sending over an inviting cross, from the just inside the box on the left 10 yards out, which was met by an unmarked Scott Honeyman in the centre of the 6 yard box. Unfortunately, Honeyman was just unable to jump high enough to get his full head to the ball and his attempt went wide of the right post. A couple of minutes later Brown sent the ball long from just inside his own half on the left to Watson near the left flag. Watson then beat Ben Mail before trying a curling shot from the left edge of the box which was easily held by Alister Torrance at the left post. In the next move Honeyman fired over a low cross from the right corner of the box through the 6 yard area but there was no takers. In a rare Students attack in the 21st minute David Maskrey moved the ball low, from the centre 25 yards out, to Max Condie on the left wing and he returned the ball back to Maskrey left of the D\u201d. The winger immediately sent the ball short to Baird in front of him who in turn squared it right into the path of Maurice. The midfielder then fired off a low shot from right of the \u201dD\u201d which went a few yards past the left post. As the half progress \u2018Shire controlled possession but were unable to create any clear cut chances. With 1 minute left of the half Watson floated in a cross, from a few yards left of the left corner of the box, which Torrance had to punch clear from Honeyman in his 6 yard area. Straight after Ewing sent a perfect pass from the halfway line on the right into Honeyman just inside the box right of centre. Honeyman let the ball bounce once before trying to guide the ball into the left corner of the net but unfortunately it went a couple of yards wide of the base of the post."},{"paragraph":"\u2018Shire started the 2nd period with renewed vigour and only 1 minute in Honeyman sent over a cross, from the right wing at the goal line, which picked out Watson at the \u201cD\u201d. Watson took a touch to his right before shooting, only to see the ball go high over the bar on the right. In the 53rd minute McDonald sent a low ball low, just in from the left corner of the box, to Hodge who took the ball round Dick before shooting low from the left corner of the 6 yard area. Unfortunately, Torrance was able to save with his feet at the left post for a corner. 5 minutes later Max Condie received the ball at the left halfway line and then played a 1 -2 with Baird to his right as he drove up the left wing. Condie\u2019s run took him all the way inside the left of the box before he released a 15 yard shot which Connelly had to parry at the left post before it was cleared. With 1 hour gone Connor Greene sent a long ball, from midway in his own half left of centre, to Trialist 17 who was racing into the box at the left of the \u201cD\u201d. Torrance came off his goal line to meet him but in diving at the feet of Trialist 17 he sent him tumbling to the ground for a stonewall penalty. Greene stepped up to take the kick and sent the ball down the middle to tie the match at 1-1. A few minutes later Trialist 17 received a Brown throw-in at the left corner of the box and ran to his right and shot. However, he did not connect properly with the ball and it went harmlessly wide of the foot of the left post With 67 minutes gone Watson cut in from the left corner of the box to the left of the \u201cD\u201d before he tried a low shot. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t get a hold of the ball and it clipped off the foot of Ainslie before it was cleared to safety. In the 73rd minute the home side missed a great chance to re-take the lead when Maskrey cut in from the right wing, to just out from the \u201cD\u201d, before releasing Baird in the clear 15 yards out in the centre. However, Connelly was able to get down at the centre of the 6 yard line to save Baird\u2019s resulting shot with his feet before it was cleared. \u2018Shire then had a glorious chance of their own a few minutes later when Marc Allan sent a great low pass, just inside the box on the right at the goal line, to Watson who was clear at the back post. Unfortunately, Torrance raced across his line to make an unbelievable save with his feet to turn Watson\u2019s stretching tap-in, from a few yards out, just over the top of the left post for a corner. A couple of minutes on and another inviting Alan cross, from near the right flag, had to be cleared by Mail on the centre of the 6 yard line under close attention by 2 Shire players. The students immediately moved up field and a cut back from Hendry, outside the right of the box, found James Lawton just in the box from the \u201cD. Fortunately for \u2018Shire Lawton\u2019s low shot was tame and easily gathered by Connelly in the centre of the goal. In the 84thminute Hamilton sent a long box, from just outside his own box left of centre, to Jasper Gray not far in from the right corner of the box. Gray went round Brown to his left and curled in a shot which flew high and wide of the left post. Then Kai Wilson headed the ball to his left on to Kenny Barr right of the \u201cD\u201d. Barr turned and fired off a shot which was easily gathered by Torrance on his goal line. With 86 gone Condie took a throw-in, 25 yards out on the left wing, to Luke Murray in the left side of the box. Under pressure, from Aiden Clocherty and Greene, Murray somehow managed to get a shot away from 10 yards which narrowly went by the base of the left post. 2 minutes on and Wilson rolled through a pass from just beyond the \u201cD\u201d to Watson who was unmarked in the left of the box. Watson hit a 1st time 10 yard low shot but it was saved by Torrance at the left of his 6 yard area. From this the students went up the park and Baird freed Gray with a pass up the centre but as the forward charged into the box and sent off his shot Clocherty cleared the danger with a sliding tackle. Straight after it was the turn of Lawton to pick out Baird with a pass, this time from 30 yards out on left wing, and he turned at the left corner of the box before moving forward and sending off a 15 yard shot low which went a fraction past the foot of the right post. 2 minutes into injury time Condie squared the ball from the left wing into the unmarked Lawton in the centre at the \u201cD\u201d. Lawton had the time to line up a low shot toward the right corner of the goal but Ewing stuck out a foot at the penalty spot and deflected the ball straight into the hands of Connelly in the centre of the 6 yard line. The 1-1 draw will have been frustrating to \u2018Shire who, despite a late flurry by the home team, had taken the game to the students but just couldn\u2019t get the winning goal."},{"paragraph":"Shire: 1) Ross Connelly 2) Tony Coutts (RB) 3) Shaun Brown (LB) 4) Kyle Ewing (RCD) 5) Connor Greene (Captain) (LCD) 6) Dean Ritchie (DRCM) 7) Scott Honeyman (RM) 8) Kenny Barr (DLCM.

Jamie Kirkpatrick replaced Daniel McDonald at Centre Forward with Kenny Barr moving to the right wing.

However, as Kirkpatrick let the ball bounce Ryan Anderson raced out to the 18 yard line and did enough to put off Kirkpatrick\u2019s poke round him to the right. This enabled Jacob Comerford time to get back and clear the ball out for a corner at the base of the left post. Shaun Brown took that corner from the right which Colts were able to clear for another corner on the right. Brown sent that corner to Ewing at the back of the 6 yard area and he headed it back into the centre of the 6 yard box. However, the referee then blew for a Colts foul after Andy Kay had brought down Cole McIntyre. Then, as Colts tried to play the ball out from goal, Jack Comerford sent square ball across his 18 yard line from the left wing to Callum Home. The centre back was way too short with his pass back to Adamson and Kirkpatrick pounced on the ball just in front of the left of the \u201cD\u201d. The young forward immediately ran forward to the left corner of the 6 yard area before slotting home beyond Adamson into the bottom right corner of the net. 1-0 \u2018Shire and only 1 minute gone. Only 3 minutes later Adamson launched the ball long from the edge of his box to McIntyre on the right touchline who then turned Jack Hodge. McIntyre let the ball bounce once before sending it to Regan McLaren who got in front of Connor Greene just right of the \u201cD\u201d. McLaren saw Ross Connelly race of his line and let the ball bounce before chipping the keeper from 18 yards into the centre of the net to tie the match. Connelly had look sharp to turn the ball round his right post in the 11th minute from a Stephen O\u2019Neill shot, from just in from the right\u201d D\u201d, after McLaren had laid the ball back to him. \u2018Shire cleared that right corner for another corner on the same side but the 2nd corner, in the 12th minute, was swung in by Dylan Tennant to the foot of the right post and was missed by Connelly to go straight into the net. A soft goal for \u2018Shire to lose. With 19 minutes gone Jack Hodge beat Home to the bounce of the ball, at the left corner of the box at the goal line, before trying his luck with a low shot a few yard further into the box but it hit the left side netting. 1 minute on and Matthew McFarlane floated over a corner from the left but McLaren was just unable to connect with his head, in the centre of the 6 yard line, and the ball went harmlessly out for a goal kick. In the 25th minute McIntyre curled a pass, from the left wing 25 yards out, which found Ewan MacPherson clear just behind the penalty spot. However, the midfielder couldn\u2019t get a clean 1st time strike and Connelly easily gathered the ball in the centre of the 6 yard line. The match then went into a period of midfield play and it wasn\u2019t until the 41st minute that there was any other real action. Cameron Dickson, at inside left 25 yards out, sent the ball to McIntyre at the right corner of the \u201cD\u201d to who then turned Brown before releasing a shot which Connelly had to save and gather at the left post. A couple of minutes later McLaren sent a low cross from the right corner of the box and Greene did well to get to the ball 1st , just right of the penalty spot, to clear from the foot of McPherson. Then Colts won a free kick, 25 yards out left of centre, from which Stephen O\u2019Neill was unlucky to see his shot scrape just over the centre of the bar with Connelly in close attendance. Straight after Stephen O\u2019Neill disposed Kay 25 yards out the right channel.

In the 52nd minute Tennant, from the centre 35 yards out, fed the ball to his left to MacPherson who ran into the left of the box before firing off a 15 yard attempt which took a deflection off Ewing for corner. 2 minutes on McLaren played a 1-2 with Dickson at the left corner of the box before turning and shooting, the ball going well wide of the top of the right post. In the 58th minute Dean Watson ran into the box at the right corner before going down from Dickson\u2019s outstretched leg but the referee was probably correct in booking Watson for diving. 1 minute later Matthew McFarlane poked a short ball to his left into the path of McIntyre just right of the \u201cD\u201d. McIntyre took a step before hitting a low shot int to the bottom right corner of the net to put Colts further ahead. That goal took the sting out of the match and in the next 10 minutes of so there was only a hopefully 25 yard shot, in the 71st minute from Comerford right of centre, to note which went well wide of the right post. \u2018Shire started to get back into the match the 76th minute when Brown swung a cross over, from the left wing 25 yards out, which was met by Scott Honeyman on the 18 yard line right of the \u201cD\u201d. However, Honeyman was only able to loop his header upwards and it was easily caught by Adamson at the penalty spot. A few minutes later Brown sent a corner in from the right which was met by Greene 6 yards out at the back post. The \u2018Shire captain headed the ball back across goal but it just evaded the foot of Kenny Barr, a few yard out from the right post, and it trickled out for a goal kick. In the 87th minute Brown swung over a right corner to an unmarked Greene at the back post but he could only send his 6 yard downwards header wide of the left post. However, 2 minutes later \u2018Shire did get a goal back. Honeyman crossed the ball low, from the right touchline 25 yards out, to Daniel McDonald just out from the right corner of the 6 yard area. McDonald then touched the ball back to Brown who went round a Colts defender before calmly shooting into the bottom left corner of the net, from just in from the centre of the \u201cD\u201d. Despite 5 minutes of injury time \u2018Shire were unable to force a grandstand finish and the match ended in a disappointing 2-3 defeat. \u2018Shire had started the match very brightly but lost their way after going behind. It wasn\u2019t until later in the match that \u2018Shire were again able to make any headway. This is a match for \u2018Shire to put behind them and focus on what is before them with the next match due to take place only in a few days\u2019 time."},{"paragraph":"Shire: 1) Ross Connelly 2) Tony Coutts (RB) 3) Shaun Brown (LB) 4) Kyle Ewing (RCD) 5) Connor Greene (Captain.
